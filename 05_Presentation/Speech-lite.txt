Slide 1:
	Good afternoon,
	Thanks everyone for being here.
	Now, we are going to present to you
	the project AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION
	made for Skillshare.

	Skillshare is an American online learning community
	to learn from educational videos.

Slide 2:

	Skillshare needs to go beyond English spoken usersA
	but videos and transcriptions are in English.

	They want to extend its target.
	They need online translations for their video transcriptions.
	
	And this process needs to be automatic 
	without affecting user experience.

	what we did was to bring an automatic service
	to translate the transcription of a video the user is viewing.


Slide 3:

	VIDEO RUNS AUTOMATICALLY

	Our solution brings what they need right now.
	In this MVP you can see how a video is shown
	with a transcription in English,
	then the user can select his or her native language
	and easily can follow the lesson
	by reading translated transcription online.

	The first time a user selects a language for a specific video,
	translation occurs and is stored for future users.

	This way the resources used are minimum
	and the process is automatic,
	without the need of somebody who runs a translation process
	each time a new video arrives.


Slide 4:	TEAM

	This is our team... Zombieland CLI
	Carlos in frontend and design
	Ivan in frontend and testing
	And myself, Leonardo in the backend


Slide 5:	ARCHITECTURE

	The architecture for this PROJECT uses AWS services
	specially
		A.P.I. Gateway
		Lambda function using Python


Slide 6:	API

	The A.P.I was an A.P.I Rest,
	we used a get method to make the request
	and then the A.P.I calls for the lambda function

Slide 7:	lambda
	
	The lambda function we created
		detects the video language
		to see if the translation requested is already stored
		and if not,
		calls a translate_text method

Slide 8: 	PROJECT

	Our project was scrum-based...
	We had weekly sprints,
	A daily meeting,
	and Sprint review on Fridays

	In addition we had Mandatory rules for the team
	and our timeline was of six weeks.

Slide 9:	CHALLENGE

	Our main challenge was achitecture definition
	
	This was because we had several options,
	and to select the optimal one we had to investigate technical details
	about how Skillshare is working right now.

Slide 10: 	LESSONS

	There was a lot of learning lessons for the team,
	
	However we want to say for sure than now we feel
	we are capable to learn what we need.
