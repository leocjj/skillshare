Slide 1:

	Good afternoon everyone,
	We are going to present you the project
		AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION
			made to Skillshare

	Skillshare is an American online learning community
	to learn from educational videos.
	The courses focus on learning by completing a project.

Slide 2:

	Skillshare needs to go beyond English spoken users
	but videos and transcriptions of this are in English

	they want to extend its target
	so they need online transcriptions for video transcriptions
	
	and this process needs to be automatic 
	without affecting user experience.

Slide 3:

	VIDEO RUNS AUTOMATICALLY

	Our solutions bring what they need right now.
	In this MVP you can see how a video is shown with a transcription in English, then the user can select his or her native language and easily can follow the lesson by reading translated transcription online.

	The first time a user selects a language for a specific video, translation occurs and is stored for future users.

	This way the resources used are minimum and the process is automatic, without the need of somebody who runs a translation process each time a new video arrives.

Slide 4:

	This is our team...
	Carlos in frontend and design
	Ivan in frontend and testing
	And myself in the backend

Slide 5:

	The architecture for this service uses AWS services including:
		API Gateway
		Lambda funcion coded in Python
		S3 objects
		Translate
		Comprehend to determin the source language
